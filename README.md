Is the idea of a Cyber Robin Hood really that far fetched?
Im no genius by any means, and up until recently thought of Quantum Physics, Epi-Genetics, Coding, was all scary stuff!!
We were told by our parents, who were told by their parents, etc. 
That its to hard to learn that, you have to go to school for 8 years, be content with a 40 hour work week and retiring BROKE at 65.

I have recieved mostly negative reactions by my family after i turned $380.00 into $6,000.00 in less then 2 weeks.
It wasnt real to them and for me to do something like that at my computer from taking a week or two in learning the basics of trading.

All my life I have given to others. My family, friends, strangers, anyone who needs help.
Asking nothing in return. 
After investing the amount of time I have into learning these new things and getting very few positives.
From people i sacrificed a lot for.
Trying to belittle and make everything a block in the road or harder for me.
Although very upsetting I finally realized I need to dedicate time to me, to not take advantage now would be a huge waste.

Very excited for what the future brings. No limitations!
